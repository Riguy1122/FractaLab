# FractaLab - FOR AXIOM
A simulation of crystal growth, using the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation process. The simulation starts with a "seed" particle and randomly bounces other particles around until they stick to the growing center crystal, creating beautiful fractal structures.

# NOTE - AI USAGE
FractaLab's codebase will not and does not directly contain AI generated code.
BUT, AI was and will be used for tech stack reccomendations, error handling, math problems, and other non-direct uses.
