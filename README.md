# FractaLab - FOR AXIOM
A simulation of Colony growth, using the Eden Growth Model. The simulation starts with a number of "seed" particles and randomly grows only at the colonies edge. You can watch as mulitple "colonies" collide at their frontiers, and as well as growth around obstacles.

# NOTE - AI USAGE
FractaLab's codebase will not and does not directly contain AI generated code.
BUT, AI was and will be used for tech stack recomendations, error handling, math problems, and other non-direct uses.
